# INCIDENT DATA PROCESSOR

## Introduction

This script is designed to automate the process of extracting and processing incident data from provided PDF files. It extracts specific details, enhances the data with additional contextual information such as weather conditions and location rankings, and outputs the processed data for further analysis.

## Usage

To run this script, you will need a file containing URLs to the incident data PDFs. The script will process each URL, extract the data, enhance it, and print the processed results. 

Here's an example command to run the script:

```
python incident_data_processor.py --urls path/to/your/url_file.csv
```

Ensure your URL file is in CSV format with each URL listed on a new line.

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script was developed using Python 3.8. You will also need to install several Python libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install PyPDF2 pandas geopy requests_cache openmeteo-requests retry-requests
```

## Assumptions

- The PDFs contain the data in a consistent format that the script expects. If the format changes, the script may not extract the data correctly.
- The location data extracted is sufficient for geolocation lookup via the ArcGIS service.
- Weather data is available for the requested date and location from the Open Meteo API.

## Known Bugs

- There is no handling for network errors or API rate limiting in the script.
- The script assumes the PDF text can be extracted cleanly, which may not be the case for all PDFs.

## Credits

- The script uses the `PyPDF2`, `pandas`, `geopy`, `requests_cache`, `openmeteo-requests`, and `retry-requests` libraries. Thanks to the developers of these libraries.
- Weather data is retrieved using the Open Meteo API.
